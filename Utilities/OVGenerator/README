This is the OpenVanilla Generator script for generating
virtually everything. Now we could generate tests very easily.

You should have perl5 to run this generator. The built-in perl of Mac
is enough.

Before run this generator, please setup an OV_ROOT environment
variable. Telling the script the root of your checkout path.
For example if you checkout ov with svn like this:

  svn co http://svn.openfoundry.org/openvanilla/trunk ~/dev/ov-trunk

Then your OV_ROOT should be ~/dev/ov-trunk.

After that, please run

  perl bin/ov-generator test ModuleId

Where ModuleId is a necessary argument. For example:

  perl bin/ov-generator test OVIMArray

And tests would be generated under ${OV_ROOT}/Modules/OVIMArray/tests/.
cd to OVIMArray dir and compile the moudle, and then cd to the 'tests/'
dir and execute 'make'. You could see a screen like this:

  > make
  g++ -Wall -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib -ltap  -o OVTester OVTester.cpp
  1..5
  ok 1 - Module loaded
  ok 2 - symbol OVGetLibraryVersion is there
  ok 3 - symbol OVInitializeLibrary is there
  ok 4 - symbol OVGetModuleFromLibrary is there
  ok 5 - Version is up-to-date

Please notice that this generated test require libtap to be installed first.

Feel free to write more general tests and make those tests program to
be templates depends on some variables. So that we could generate
more tests. :)

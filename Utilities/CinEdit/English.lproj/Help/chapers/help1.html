<h2>Introduction to a Table-based Input Method</h2>

<p>The Table-based Input Methods is an usual way to make inputing
Chinese, Japanese or Korean characters into practice. This means that
they simply have a large table in memory, associating different
characters to their respective representations. The input method then
simply becomes a table lookup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many popular Chinese Input Methods are designed as
table-based, for instance, Canjei(倉頡), Zhuyin (注音, Bopomofo), Pinyin
(拼音) and so on.</p>

<p>There are two strata to design a Table-based Input Method, one
is key-mapping while another is Character-definitions. At first, users
should type in a key from the keyboard, and each key represents a
component of a character, and then user use combinations of such
components to compose a C.J.K character.</p>

<p>Because the amont of C.J.K characters are much more than the
keys on a keyboard, users must use two or more keys to type a
character. Then each character must be seperated into variable
components. For example, when a user type "a" in Canjei Input Method,
it will display "日" instead, and then he or she can continue type "b"
which will be "月", and usr "日" and "月" to compose the character "明".</p>

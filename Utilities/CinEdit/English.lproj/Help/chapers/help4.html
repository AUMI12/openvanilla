<h2>The Key-mappings</h2>
<p>The key-mappings defines the keys and the substitute
character mapping to the keys.  </p>
<p>The items in the "Key" column represents which key
you type on your keyboard, it must be a lower-cased letter or a
punctuation, in other words, it must be a printable ASCII character.
You can check the detial of the ASCII characters from the file located
in <code>/usr/share/misc/ascii</code> in your harddisk, or refer the man-page of
"isprint" or "ascii".</p>
<p> A "substitute character" is the character to represent which
key you typed and will show in the input buffer area in order compose
which character or phrase you want to type. It's usually one CJK
character or roman letter, however, you can also use two or more
characters to represent a component of a CJK character.</p>
<h3>"End Keys"</h3>
<p>An "<span style="font-weight: bold;">End Key</span>"
does not mean the "End" key on your keyboard, but means the keys to
stop composing a CJK character and send the content of the input buffer
into your applications immediately. </p>
<p>In most situations, users use space-key or enter key to stop
composing characters, but it is also possible to use other keys defined
here to stop composing. The "End Keys" are often used for inputing CJK
full-width punctuations. For example,  in most Input Methods,
a common is often mapping to the common key; When user hope to input a
common without typing an extra space key, the common key should be set
as an "End Key".</p>

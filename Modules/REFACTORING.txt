== Criteria for refactoring for 0.7.2-release ==

* Must have license header
* Makefile complies to the new convention:
** Uses shared data from ../SharedData
** Uses shared headers and source from ../SharedHeaders and ../SharedSource
** Uses "../Mk/ov.module.mk"
** Changes variable IMID to MODULEID
** Offers HAS_VARIANTS if there is any variant
** Makes with "build, install, clean, help" targets

== What MUST Be Refactored ==

Every make.bat (for Windows) must be reviewed.
Otherwise it's guaranteed to break!

== Not Yet Refactored Modules ==

* OVIMBoshiamy
* OVIMChewing
* OVIMExample
* OVIMGeneric
* OVIMGenericSQLite
* OVIMPOJ-Holo
* OVIMRoman
* OVIMRomanNew
* OVIMSpaceChewing
* OVIMTibetan
* OVIMTobacco
* OVIMUIM
* OVIMUnicode
* OVKPAbbreviator
* OVKPPhraseTools
* OVOFDisUniHex
* OVOFExample
* OVOFFullWidthCharacter
* OVOFHTMLCharEntity
* OVOFMorseCode
* OVOFPHP
* OVOFQuotationmark
* OVOFReverseLookup
* OVOFSpeak
* OVOFZhWikipidealize

== Refactoring in Progress ==

* OVOFAntiZhuyinwen (its xcodeproj variant needs to be re-created)
* SharedData (more to be moved from trunk/Data)

== Refactored Modules ==

* OVIMBig5
* OVIMArray
* OVIMPhonetic (variants: sqlite bpmf-extended)
* OVOFHanConvert
* Mk/ (not counted as module, but the build system also needs refactoring)
* SharedHeaders/
* SharedSource/

== Scraped/Must-Be-Rewritten Modules ==

Many of these are out-of-date, not well maintained, or discarded. To
refactor/clean up these modules will require some efforts (e.g. the
rewriting of Makefile's)

* Experiments/OVIMAutoPhonetic
* Experiments/OVIMKeypadExample
* Experiments/OVKPPhrase
* Experiments/ProtocolBased

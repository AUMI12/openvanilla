This Output filter convers kanji character used in zh_tw to its jp variant.
It doen'st work very good because

(1) It is not a one-to-one mapping
(2) There are some false mapping in the current table.

Currently used table is a derivative work from
http://kanji.zinbun.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yasuoka/ftp/CJKtable/DailyUse.Z , which
collets only commonly used characters and it has more exact mapping
information. (That file is encoded with ISO-2022-7bit, which is not easily
handled because it use cns11643-1. I have to use Encode::HanExtra perl module
to fully read it.) Based on this table I created another table called
"tw2jp.txt" in the module directory. Which is now the main table of this
output filter module. Users may directly edit that text file (utf8 encoding)
and re-run

  make table
  make
  make install

to install the new table. The "gentable.pl" script is used to get the job
done.

Previously used table is a derivative work from "Unihan Variant Dictionary"
<http://www.ideographer.com/article/uvd.php>.  The script
"gen-variant-table.pl" pick-up code points from the file "UniVariants" and
find those used in big5 and shiftjis, and make a big5->shitjis search to see
if such mapping could be applied for each records.

However, such conversion may still be wrong because:

(1) Just because they are variants to each other doesn't mean
    it should be converted.
(2) The conversion may end up in the range of rare characters
    in Japanese, which might not be good enough.

So please give it a try, and try to make the table better.

Cheers,

This Output filter convers kanji character used in zh_tw to its jp variant.
It doen'st work very good because

(1) It is not a one-to-one mapping
(2) There are some false mapping in the current table.

THe current table is a derivative work from "Unihan Variant Dictionary"
<http://www.ideographer.com/article/uvd.php>.  The script "gentable.pl"
pick-up code points from the file "UniVariants" and find those used in big5
and shiftjis, and make a big5->shitjis search to see if such mapping could be
applied for each records.

However, such conversion may still be wrong because:

(1) Just because they are variants to each other doesn't mean
    it should be converted.
(2) The conversion may end up in the range of rare characters
    in Japanese, which might not be good enough.

So please give it a try, and try to make the table better.

Cheers,
Kang-min Liu

The python wrap code is generated using SWIG 1.3.20 in the Fink distribution.
The code is tested in X.4.10 using the default python2.3.  The makefile will
need to be modified for testing in X.5 or using other version of python.

The swig code is submitted as source for people who want to test it out without
swig.

Also, the safty mechanism for loading only one copy of python has not be implemented
yet.  Namely, it might be problem if you use OVOFPythonBased and OVIMPythonBases
at the time.


Build:

make OVIMPython
make DSTROOT=~ install

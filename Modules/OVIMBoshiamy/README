OVIMBoshiamy is a implementation of Boshiamy input method 
for OpenVanilla framework. Since Boshiamy table is propietory,
it should not be included in the release of this module, nor
be included in the source code repository.

Please deal with license issue very carefully. We are only
allowed to write code that can process Boshiamy table.

If you have a legal copy of LIU57 standard version CDROM, please copy
"/UNIX/xcin2.5/liu5.cin" (168,629 bytes) to this directory.

Cheers,

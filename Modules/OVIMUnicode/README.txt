This packages includes OVIMUnicode.dylib, a "Unicode" input method 
for OpenVanilla. This compiled binary works for OpenVanilla 0.7.0rc5.
To use this input method module, simple copy this .dylib file to
the following directory:

    /Library/OpenVanilla/0.7.0/Modules
    
Note you'll be prompted for system administrator password if you drag
OVIMUnicode.dylib into the above-mentioned folder. You can do it by
command line too:

    sudo cp OVIMUnicode.dylib /Library/OpenVanilla/0.7.0/Modules/
    
That's all there is. :)

This builds a minimal OpenVanilla loader required for limited environemnts.
Type "make" to build the binary, called "engine-test".

The demo consists of four parts:

engine-test.cpp
	the input method application that makes use of the
	MinimalLoader engine.
	
MinimalLoader.h
MinimalLoader.cpp
	The minimal OpenVanilla implementation that also loads the linked
	module (here OVIMPhonetic).
	
OpenVanilla.h
OVLibrary.h
OVUtility.h
OVOSDef.h
	The OpenVanilla Framework (yes, only headers).
	
OVIMPhoneticStatic.cpp
OVPhoneticLib.h
OVPhoneticLib.cpp
OVPhoneticData.c
	The BPMF ("phonetic") input method.
	
To replace the input method module, simply link the engine-test against
another input method module. By default only one module is loaded.

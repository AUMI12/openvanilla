Need a Makefile.
Lucene is a full-text search engine.
CLucene is Lucene's C++ version.
Lucene has a "fuzzy search" functionality that uses "Edit Distance" algorithm.
This is a basic algorithm for spelling checkers.
For example, LuceneSearch::run("roam~", vector<const char*>& vecRef) should
provide similary words of roam such as "foam" or "roams" within vecRef.

If you wanna build CLucene on your own, please use CVS trunk version on its
SourceForge site, and you will need autoconf/automake/libtool (suckers).

Unfortunately, the Perl wrapper of CLucene seems to work on Linux only, since
its Makefile behaves like that.

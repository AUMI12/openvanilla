To write an input method on OS X, this is actually all you need.
I wrote this as a pre-requisite for the OpenVanilla Project, hence
the target names.

To test it, build both OVInit and OVLoader targets (if you only build
OVLoader, it will automatically builds OVInit as well), place
build/OVInit.bundle under /Library/Components, and
place build/OVLoader.bundler under /Library/OpenVanilla/0.7/Loader,
and remember to enable OpenVanilla 0.7 under System Preference->
International->Input methods, and then you can give it a try.

To write your own input method, change OVLoader.mm, and the 
related headers for the bundle identifiers, bundle path, and other
additional information.

Enjoy,

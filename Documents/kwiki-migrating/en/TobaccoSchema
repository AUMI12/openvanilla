* key2word table schema:  |key|wordID|ord|
* word table schema:      |wordID|word|
* frequency table schema: |wordID|freq|

* The reasons why to separate into 3 tables are:
00 Characters can be different by different input methods.
00 Different frequency table represents different "context" or "user profile," for example, "[=freq_zh_Hant_contextBar]." 
00 Support words in zh_Hans and zh_Holo, etc.

A SQL statement for example:
 SELECT
     word_zh_Hant.word,
     freq_zh_Hant_generic.freq,
     key2word_bpmf.ord
 FROM key2word_bpmf, word_zh_Hant, freq_zh_Hant_generic
 WHERE key2word_bpmf.key = 'foo'
     AND word_zh_Hant.wordID = key2word_bpmf.wordID
     AND word_zh_Hant.wordID = freq_zh_Hant_generic.wordID
 ORDER BY freq_zh_Hant_generic.freq DESC"

Since there're two inner joins, the order of tables and columns are very very important.

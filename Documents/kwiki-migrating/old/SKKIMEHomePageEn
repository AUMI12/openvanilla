* When the `` [ the '' and the `` ] the '' is included in Annotation, correction of the bug where when it does, after of the candidacy cannot select dictionary search. (Sabimaru and the bug report thank
you)
* In Annotation the `` [ the case where the '' is included the modification of rule of nonpoisonous conversion. Being to be piled up with the problem above, it does, but when the `` [ the candidacy which
includes the '' is registered to annotation, (concat...) Being registered, register contents are broken. This bug fix was done.
* Way Text Service Framework side annotation is indicated, correction.
* Changing to plural candidacy from single candidacy indication, when

you pushed ``x'' and resetting to single candidacy indication, the correction of bug which is not just indicated in the case where exactly there is annotation in that candidacy.

=== [ 2004/12/08 ] ===

Snap20041208 was put in place. The modification from snap20040929 is as follows.

* When process which suspend is done exists in Windows2000 environment correction of the bug which the whole system stops. Thanks to Max Burmistrov for reporting the bug report about suspended
process.

=== [ 2004/09/29 ] ===

Snap20040929 was put in place. The modification from snap20040317 is as follows.

* It tried to use tooltip in the indication of annotation.
* It tried to attach the lapel to minibuffer indication.

=== [ 2004/03/17 ] ===

Snap20040317 was put in place. The modification from snap20040223 is as follows.

* Compile it did again to do with the setting of the Text Service Framework which with Windows2000 has been made invalid for the second time as effective.
* When X-Mouse is utilized, Window having made whichever setting, automatically, the bug which appears in the foremost aspect fix was done. (TOYAMA Sumio and the bug report, thank you)
* The bug where color setting "in the character string which is in the midst of converting" is not reflected fix was done with application which utilizes Text Service Framework.

=== [ 2004/02/23 ] ===

Snap20040223 was put in place. The modification from snap20040218 is "error occurring when the logging on to Windows2000, correction of the bug which is stopped". (KOMURA Kazuhiro and association in debugging, it was grateful)

=== [ 2004/02/18 ] ===

Snap20040218 was put in place. As for the modification from snap20040214, uistate.C was rewound to the point in time of snap20040203, is. As for this vis-a-vis the bug that "error occurs immediately after the logging on to Windows, stops there" uistate.Because you thought whether c problem is. (KOMURA Kazuhiro and the report thank you) Taking Ae you do not obtain, it is intention of the
circumstances seeing with this. In addition "when IME of the picture of Winlogon is designated as
skkime, because it cannot cause skkiserv, you became aware in the bug that but every time of conversion (that by all means fails) means long haul to be made wait", remaining. As expected, the fact that IME over there is changed the male be completed, being not to be possible, it does, but something it is the intention of coping. (It became easy to test with the shade of virtualpc)

=== [ 2004/02/14 ] ===

Snap20040214 was put in place. The modification from snap20040203 is only delicate adjustment.

* Renewal frequency of the language bar, timing was adjusted.
* As status window was white the fact that the period when it is indicated is long at the place of WM_ERASEBKGND the to sesame was converted by the fact that "the invalid time bitmap" is stuck. Is. If with adjustment of the language bar of former, you can hold down the phenomenon where the language bar becomes the non reaction, with you have expected.

=== [ 2004/02/04 ] ===
Snap20040203 was put in place. As for the modification point
from snap20031212,
* When combining with application or shell of specification
such as LiteStep, status window becomes the non reaction, (NAKAMURA
Toshikazu and the bug report thank you),
* [ TSF ] Directly, the case where selects candidacy with 2nd
menu of code input mode the key is not just indicated,
It is correction of bug.

SKKIME is one kind of Input Method Editor which operates on
Microsoft Windows. It is distributed as free software which you follow
GNU General Public License. Thing and Windows2000 which presently
operate with Windows'98 (Professional?) 2 Tsugas of those which operate at on it exists.
As for SKKIME, Nemacs, Mule, Imitating to the system, SKK which offers the Japanese input
environment which operates on Demacs it mounts in the form of IME of

Installation method
SKKIME98. which is included in the distribution fileThe right please click INF. If the item, installation which is
included in the menu is chosen, the necessary file is copied and
installation is completion.
When using SKKIME98, "setting" -> the "control panel" -> "the
keyboard" -> please add SKKIME98 with "language".
Usually with ALT + SHIFT changing IME, the fact that you use probably
is good fortune. The application and the like which uses IME FUNCTION
is the expectation which does not move. (Reading was obtained from
Chinese character to be, as for such being not to be possible)
When execute form is made from the source code
1. Http: /Www.Microsoft.Com/Windows'98 DDK is picked up from ddk. When Windows'98 DDK is installed
already, this job is unnecessary.
2. Windows'98 DDK is installed. You think that with default it is
installed to /98DDK.
3. /98DDK/Src/Ime/The change of jpn of jpn it makes move with the name which
comparatively calls the source tree of SKKIME98 jpn.
4. /98DDK/Lib/I386/[ Free,Checked ] From library of Visual C++ ws2_32.Lib is copied.
Preparation was prepared with this.
1. /98DDK/Src/Ime/Jpn/Skkiserv/[ A,M ] Moving, nmake.Exe is executed. Skkiserv.Exe and skkisrvm.Exe is made. Please correct Makefile appropriately according to need.
E.g., compiling option is modified....
2. /98DDK/Src/Ime/When build -Z is executed with jpn, SKKIME98 to be done build,
/98DDK/Lib/I386/[ Free,Checked ] The file is copied below. This is the same as the build
method of the other sample of DDK. This time, skkiserv.Exe, Skkisrvm.Because it copies also exe together, the necessity make to do first

The people bug reporting, thank you truly.
AlphaXX deleted for the Web Page restriction of Nifty. Because it is
kept in labor assistant, there is a bug of former times and that we
want version, the one which is said please does the mail in my

From alpha version the renewal past record to beta this is.

The trouble which presently is known (the problematical point)
it is as follows.
* Uninstall it is not possible. "C:WindowsSystemskkime98.Ime ","C:WindowsSystemskkim98m.Ime ", "C:If WindowsImeSkkime98 "it deletes, you take and Ae not obtaining
Uninstall are possible. In that case beforehand please delete SKKIME98
from the property of the keyboard. Registry please deletes under
softwaremiscwindowscurrentversion of CURRENT_USER and LOCAL_MACHINE.
* When communicating with skkserv, because it waits for TimeOut
accurately, the reaction becomes sluggish. There is no either function
that, skkserv it reads the auxiliary dictionary when skkserv does not
exist either a function that it goes to causing.
* The cord/code of the user dictionary is made Japanese EUC deciding
striking.
* Appointing the skk-aux-large dictionary, it seems that is the times
when it cannot be good and read the dictionary. Wskkserv.If exe is utilized, kana Chinese character conversion in possibility
being a certain way, it does, but....

=== [ SKKIME for Windows2000 ] ===
==== circumstance of development ====
Skkiserv was rewritten extensively. In addition the setting
part of dialog was renovated.
The difference with the Windows'98 edition is as follows.
* As for IME skkiserv.It exchanges message making use of exe and Named Pipe. As for actually
managing the dictionary skkiserv.It has become the work of exe.
* Is only Unicode edition from the restriction of Windows2000.
* It was not to make setting the file, in order to place in registry,
it corrected.
* Skkiserv. of the time beforeDifferent from exe, skkiserv.Those where exe reads have become just dictionary setting. (What it
does that parse it does lisp inside DLL had the excessiveness, but
being to try to write on registry)
==== known problematical point ====
* Insufficiency of setting dialogue: As for color setting
dialogue such as the color setting dialogue which is in the midst of
inputting mounting (2003/01/10)
* Defectiveness of setting dialogue: Some buttons do not
operate ("renewal")
* LISP: Because j-num-list has not been renewed, times does not
operate.
* User dictionary: State decision of the user dictionary at the time
of skkiserv start is sweet.
* UI Window RootWindow Style? When being, it becomes strange. When
(letter input is tried in the desktop, it can reproduce simply)
* When it re-converts when IME has closed it becomes strange.
(2003/01/02)
* There are times when it fails in okuri-ari search of the sort
being completed dictionary. That it will make reappear with labor
assistant, while the test, still concrete reappearance method does not
understand. At the time of Release Build, being caught to
optimization, it seems that occurs. Because it corrected the part
where problem arises due to optimization, the test with Release Build
in the midst of continuation. (2003/01/04) The pattern which fix it is
possible. (2003/01/10)
* Meaning is indicated in the case of candidacy indication.
However, because this relates to also the design of conversion
candidacy indication Window, how it solves, you have not happened to
think yet. The display function of Annotation addition (2003/01/13)
* There is no cooperation with the Text Service Framework. As
for Text Service Framework OfficeXP, It is the substitute which administers around Toolbar where WindowsXP
extends. It does not go to the correspondence of Text Service
Framework, but adding the cord/code for the language bar. (2003/01/27)
Correcting the bug of stage of 2003/01/27. (2003/01/30) When it makes
IME of default, correction of the bug which falls lively? (2003/02/01)
Initialization/Adjustment of non initialization position. (2003/02/02) Furthermore
adjustment. (2003/02/13)
* Logoff becomes slow? (2003/04/28) It is in the midst of
correcting & the test.
* The warning UserEnv appears in the application of the event log.
(2003/05/28) It is in the midst of investigating. Whether doing that
some operation is bad concretely... (of course registry operation
problem is reason, but).

After all, the language bar (Text Service Framework) turning is
difficult, don't you think? is.... If there is a sample in DDK, being
to be good, it does, but. (It is in PlatformSDK, but there probably
will make COM becomes)
==== it has entered into the mounted list, but function of not
yet mounting ====
* The mounting Reconversion. The cooperation with kakasi of
Reconversion.
* Reverse Conversion. With respect to structure of the dictionary, the
fact that adverse change exchanging is done it is very difficult,
but... it adds to the list once. Perhaps only the extent which
cooperates with kakasi there is the hand.
* Correspondence of associative dictionary and edict dictionary....
* Actualization of Text Service Framework. For example, with Outlook
Express the language bar is not renewed securely, but because this is
called by way of Text Service Framework, is. With next term Windows as
for IME expecting, that certainly it becomes COM, if now it does not
do the sushi and this correspondence.... Temporary mounting (while
test) (2003/05/28)
* Control of recurrent register mode. Playing with PSO, when...
it enters into recurrent register mode in the kyat, because it is sad,
for example that "the candidacy indicatory window the own expense (IME
side) with when it cannot have, it does not enter into recurrent
register mode", that, it tries to be able to control with Property
setting you think. Once, mounting..., securely does not indicate
composition window on IME, that is not conveyed questions sows from
application, it does not operate is. Indicating the window in outside
the picture, in the type which we assume that sesame conversion so, it
does not operate well. In addition... there is no this operation on
Text Service Framework side, is. Whether being able to obtain what
information from application...? (2003/05/28)
* T-Code input.
* It corresponds to DVORAK arrangement.
* #4, of numerical conversion Mounting the #5. (After 1.0 releases ending this, it should do or)
Because at WINDDK2600 development is done, as for source itself
WindowsXP/2000 being both, it is the expectation which can draw up the
binary which moves, but you do not verify still securely.

cannot choose direct input thing and the equality process whose
position of check of the menu is random, ICON remaining in the
language bar and without being the tool button, is.
* Being to be the useless making that [ fix ] search of the server

==== the method of adding to Text Service Framework ====
When install is done making use of inf, below IME/ WINDOWS directoryUnder SKKIM10 skimic.You think that dll is copied.
    Cd %windir%IMESKKIM10
    Regsvr32 skimic.Dll
With install is possible by the fact that it does.
Doing, one time install the stripe uninformed it meaning that deletion
is difficult, please note. In order uninstall to do, it is necessary
to compile registry.
Making use of the registry editor,
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftCTFTIP
{830DE831-E04D-40BB-8683-1E179A5F1A4F}
Please delete below the key. Cooperation with Text Service
Framework edition and IME is cut off with this.
Or,
   Regsvr32/U skimic.dll
It executes.
The advantage of integrating with Text Service Framework is as
follows.
* Moving the setting tab of security of Internet Explorer, after
pushing application or OK, the reaction is light.
* Indicatory order of the language bar becomes just. (Originally
unless the idea contest of input mode and the like occurs to the left
side of help, it is not good)
Text Service Framework edition still is in the midst of drawing
up and in the midst of the test. The following function has missed
concretely.
* LISP conversion and date input
* Operation from language bar menu
* Reconversion (mounting = ITfReconversion)
* The test (verifying in a general way operation, the several
trying writing the mail, you tried, to is)
==== operation verification the application which does ====
* OfficeXP personal (just, with it becomes in a general way
but)
* Outlook Express 6.0sp1
* Internet Explorer 6.0sp1
==== Undocumented information ====
Securely unless you must collect, while thinking, that,
(furthermore it is difficult to understand) you write the function
which is not stated everywhere.
* There is an order in the list box of dictionary setting dialogue.
From above the dictionary is searched in order, also the conversion
result is produced to that order. To replace the search order of the
dictionary, Drag & Drop doing the element of the list, please make
move.
* From kana mode JISX0201-1976-KATAKANA input mode (generally known
half angle カナ input mode) to with it changes with Control-q,
(toggle operation).
* It is possible as for the number, to insert roundly once directly
from code input.

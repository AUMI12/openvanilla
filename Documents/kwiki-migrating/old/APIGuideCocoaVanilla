= !CocoaVanilla =

!CocoaVanilla is the core library of !OpenVanilla's OS X Loader. It consists of the following components:

* !CVBuffer: OS X implementation of TSM buffer (but this is not the /working code/, see note)
* !CVCandidate: A bridge code that translates IM modules' !OVBuffer requests into !OVDisplayServer calls (via Objective-C RPC)
* !CVConfig: configuration management
* !CVDictionary: OS X implementation of !OVDictionary
* !CVEmbeddedLoader: a mininature loader used by !OVPreferences.app; ideally this will set an example for the future/possible !OVLoaderLibrary-OSX
* !CVKeyCode: OS X implementation of !OVKeyCode with OS X-specific key code translation functions
* !CVLoader: /the monster/, !OVLoader-OSX
* !CVLoaderConfig: default settings for the !OVLoader-OSX
* !CVLoaderUtility: some house-keeping functions, "module milking" utilities
* !CVService: OS X implementation of !OVService, incl. encoding converstion functions (implemented using Carbon's !CFString functions)
* !CVSmartMenu: OS X gives IM component a space for the "pencil menu," which is not really very flexible; this module is a work-around
* !CVWrappers: Objective-C wrapper for !OVModule class

!CocoaVanilla also uses !NSExtensions library to extend some of Cocoa's functionalities, e.g. !NSString and !NSMutableDictionary

== Written in Objective-C++ ==

!CocoaVanilla is written in Objective-C++ (Objective-C plus C++), a mixture of Apple's engineering marvel.

== Notes ==

The working code that implements Apple's TSM component lies in another part of !OVLoader-OSX which is called !ATSComponent (Apple Text Service Component), which is pure C and Carbon.

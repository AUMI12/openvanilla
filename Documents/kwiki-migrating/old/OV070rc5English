= Welcome to !OpenVanilla 0.7.0rc5 =

We're still working on the English version of this site. Currently, information available in English includes:

* [A brief introduction to OpenVanilla http://openvanilla.org/index.cgi?English]

* [Zonble on the Tibetan Portal and the OpenVanilla Project http://zonble.twbbs.org/archives/2005_04/746.php#more-746] -- zonble is the person behind OV's !OVIMTibetan module.

=== A Quick Start: Obtainiing !OpenVanilla 0.7.0rc5 ===

The base installation package, along with a basic set of pre-bundled input methods and output filters, can be downloaded from [Academia Sinica's OpenFoundry http://rt.openfoundry.org/Foundry/Project/Download/Attachment/34058/24045/OpenVanilla-OSX-Base-0.7.0rc5.dmg.zip] .

OS X Tiger's Safari has a stupid bug that appends a ".exe" extension after the .zip file. Please move it manually before you unpack it.

For extra input methods: all input method data tables (.cin files) available for OV 0.6.3's generic input method (previously !OVIMXcin, now renamed to !OVIMGeneric) can be used on OV 0.7.0rc5 without any modification. Obtain extra .cin files at http://svn.openfoundry.org/openvanilla/branches/0.6/InputMethodExtra/OVIMXcinExtra/ and put the downloaded .cin file into [=/Library/OpenVanilla/0.7.0/Modules/OVIMGeneric/] . Then *open a new application* (currently existing applications can not be aware of the existence of new data tables), you'll find a new IM available at the "pencil menu."

If you want to create a .cin of your own, please follow the structure of the .cin files available. Make sure that it's encoded in UTF-8.

Also, for Pinyin users: it is possible to use the pinyin.cin table to type Chinese. You can even use it to get Traditional Chinese using OV's TC-to-SC output filter. But do please note that currently OV does not have a "smart" Pinyin IM that works like Apple's ITABC. OV bundles Chewing, a smart IM for Traditional Chinese, but you have to learn to use Bopomofo. Any participation on the creation of an open source "smart" IM is therefore welcome!

=== Information on 0.7.0rc5 ===

Features of this version include:

* Output filters: a plug-in framework that accommodates a variety of filtering modules. This package comes with filters that do Traditional-Simplified Chinese conversion, full-width ASCII output and reverse radical lookup (for Cangjei, Array, Phonetic/Bopomofo and POJ-Holo input methods).
* A comprehensive set of customizable preferences, including candidate window/notification window settings, warning sound, module shortcut key, module load list, and many more.

=== Installation instructions ===

If this is your first time installing OpenVanilla on OS X 10.3 (Panther), please go to the Input Menu tab (under International preference panel in the System Preferences application) and check OpenVanilla 0.7.0rc5 (listed as a Traditional Chinese input method due to system limitation, while in fact OpenVanilla does more than Traditional Chinese :). If you're installing OpenVanilla on OS X 10.4, the input method should be already activated after reboot. If not, please follow the steps above to enable it.

As this package comes with a large number of modules, it is recommended that you open OpenVanilla Preferences (in the "pencil" menu, shown with a vanilla flower icon, when you launch any application and switch to OpenVaniilla) and deselect modules that you don't use for the instant. This shortens OpenVanilla's loading time. Please note: while shortcut key changes are applied system-wide the moment you close OpenVanilla Preferences, you may notice that this is not true for the module menu. Due to OS X's system design limitations, you will have to relaunch every currently running application in order to see the changes in the load list (usually becoming shorter) take effect.

=== Notes ===

Note this is a rc (release candidate) package. This means although the features of the software are already there, many of them still require further polishing. There will certainly be bugs or roughness in the preset form. WE CANNOT HOLD ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY INSTALLING OR USING THIS PACKAGE. Please take caution if you want to use this version in production environment.

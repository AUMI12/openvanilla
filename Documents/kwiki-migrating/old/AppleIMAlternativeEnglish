Apple's OS X has already come with a Traditional Chinese Input Method (TCIM) and a Simplified Chinese Input Method (SCIM) module. For many people who are more familiar with the Chinese IMs available on Windows, however, Apple's built-in modules may not work like what the users are accustomed to, and there are also users who complain about those build-ins' performance and behavior (such as Hanyin may not always automatically pick up the desired phrase for you).

For those who seek alternative, take a look at OpenVanilla (http://openvanilla.org). OpenVanilla is designed by a team of Taiwanese developers that aim to fill the gap that Apple has been leaving for years. It is a simple and flexible framework that currently accomodates more than 20 loadable IM modules (latest stable version: 0.6.3). Its five major modules (Chewing, Phonetic, Cangjei, Dayi, Array) offer keyboard layouts or IM behavior more similiar to their Windows counterparts, and because of that OpenVanilla has become a major choice for Windows "switchers" in Taiwan, Hong and even in China.

But OpenVanilla is not just designed for the Chinese language. A Tibetan IM and a Taiwanese Holo IM are both available along with the standard install package of OpenVanilla 0.6.3. With its minimalistic design, it is easy to write one of your own, too.

One advantage of OpenVanilla over Apple's built-in modules is that OpenVanilla is open source software. Many of its table-based IMs (e.g. Phonetic, Cangjei, Dayi) have openly available data source and one can easily modify the table to suit his or her needs. All that requires is an editor that can edit UTF-8 documents. The developers are continuting their efforts in making OpenVanilla better. And as in any open source project, people interested in any aspect of IM development is therefore very welcome!

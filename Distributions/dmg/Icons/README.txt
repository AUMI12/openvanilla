OpenVanilla 0.7.2 for OS X
Icons Pack

Copyright (c) 2004-2006 The OpenVanilla Project

This package contains several icons that you can use to replace the
default "vanilla" icon of OpenVanilla. To replace the icon, control-click
on OpenVanilla-TSComponent-0.7.2.bundle (located in /Library/Components),
the Finder will show a pop-up menu, and click on "Show Package Contents".
Now go into the folder "Contents" then "Resources", and you'll find
a file called OpenVanillaMenuIcon.icns.

Now pick up any icon you like and rename it to OpenVanillaMenuIcon.icns,
drag the newly renamed file into the folder and replace the file
(you may be prompted by the Finder for administrator privilege), and
it's done.

To see the newly replaced icon, we have two choices. Either we can
logout, then login again, which is a bit tedious, or we can trick OS X
into reloading the icon: open the "International" panel in System Preferences,
and go to the "Input Menu" tab, uncheck OpenVanilla first, then quit
System Preferences. Now go into the same settings panel again, check 
and activate OpenVanilla, and the new icon finally shows up!

Most icons here are made by zonble, and they are, as usual, "licensed"
under the terms of the so-called one-sentence Zonble's License, which
reads:

    "How could a person who doesn't even believe in law adopt any license?"

Enjoy it!

description         package of popular Chinese input methods
long_description    \
    OpenVanilla is a lightweight text entry (input method \
    editor, or IME) and output processing architecture. It is \
    very popular among Chinese-speaking OS X users as it \
    provides many IMEs not found or not satisfactorily \
    implemented in Apple\'s built-in modules. This installs \
    the base package, including the Framework, the Loader \
    and a set of popular modules for Traditional and \
    Simplified Chinese. Note this will install bundles into \
    your Library directory, as such is required for any text \
    service (input method) components. RESTART REQUIRED.

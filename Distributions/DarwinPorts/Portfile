description         an input method editor (IME) package
long_description    OpenVanilla is a lightweight text entry (input method \
                    editor; IME) and output processing architecture. It's \
                    very popular among Chinese-speaking OS X users as it \
                    provides many IMEs not found or not as well implemented \
                    in Apple's built-in modules. This installs the base \
                    package, including the Framework, the Loader and a set \
                    of popular modules for Traditional and Simplified \
                    Chinese. Note this will install bundles under /Library , \
                    as it must work as a text service component under \
                    OS X.

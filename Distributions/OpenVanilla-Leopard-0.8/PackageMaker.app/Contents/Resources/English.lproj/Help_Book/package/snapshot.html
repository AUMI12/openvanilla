			<h1>Creating Snapshot Packages</h1>
			
			<p>A snapshot package is a two-step process allowing you to easily make a package containing all files added to a directory after a certain point in time. In the <a href="#create">first step</a>, a snapshot of the directory is taken, and stored into a .snapshot bundle. In the <a href="#package">second step</a>, this snapshot is compared against the current state of the directory and a package is created containing the files added since the snapshot. Both steps are currently done using the PackageMaker CLI.</p>

			<a name="create"></a>
			<h3>Creating the Snapshot</h3>
			<p>To create a snapshot package, you must first create the snapshot which will later be compared against the directory. To create a snapshot, use the following command:</p>

			<pre>/Developer/Tools/packagemaker --snapshot root-path destination-path</pre>

			<p>For example, to snapshot <code>~/Documents/MyGreatApp</code>, you might use:</p>

			<pre>/Developer/Tools/packagemaker --snapshot ~/Documents/MyGreatApp
	~/Docments/MyGreatApp.snapshot</pre>

			<p>typed on one line. This would create the snapshot directory <code>~/Documents/MyGreatApp.snapshot</code>. The structure of this directory would be as follows:</p>

			<pre>
- MyGreatApp.snapshot
    - Contents
        Info.plist
        snapshot.bom</pre>

			<p>The Info.plist contains the path to the original directory. The snapshot.bom file is a bill-of-materials file specifying the contents of the directory when the snapshot was taken.</p>

			<a name="package"></a>
			<h3>Creating the Snapshot Package</h3>
			<p>After creating the snapshot and adding whatever files you like to the directory, you can create a snapshot package containing only the added files. This is done much like creating a normal package with the CLI:</p>

			<pre>/Developer/Tools/packagemaker -build -snapshot snapshot-path [other options]</pre>

			<p>Essentially, in addition to all the normal CLI options, you specify the path to the snapshot directory. Note however that you do not need to specify a root directory - PackageMaker will use the directory specified in the Info.plist of the snapshot directory. For a full description of the other available options, see the <code>packagemaker</code> man page.</p>

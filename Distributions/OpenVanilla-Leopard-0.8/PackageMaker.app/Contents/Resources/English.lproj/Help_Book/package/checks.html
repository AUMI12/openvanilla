			<h1>Checking That an Install Should Proceed</h1>

			<p>There are two ways to specify the installation requirements for your package. <a href="#requirements">The first</a> works only on 10.3 or later but is easier, safer, and involves modifying the Info.plist file. <a href="#scripts">The second</a> works on all versions of OS 10 and involves writing scripts.</p>

			<a name="requirements"></a>
			<h3>The Requirements Mechanism</h3>
			<p>The requirements mechanism works only on systems running 10.3 or later. PackageMaker provides an interface to edit the requirements in the &ldquo;Configuration&rdquo; tab of the user interface. PackageMaker will make the necessary modifications to the Info.plist and will also write installation and volume check scripts for you.<br><a href="reqsDict.html">More Info...</a></p>

			<p>You can also specify the requirements by hand via editing the Info.plist. For more information, see <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/SoftwareDistribution/Concepts/sd_spec_install_req.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001949">Specifying Installation Requirements</a> in the Software Distribution documentation.</p>

			<p>This mechanism is safer as it does not involve executing arbitrary executables on the user's machine. Therefore, Installer.app will not present a warning before running these read-only checks.</p>

			<h3>InstallationCheck and VolumeCheck Scripts</h3>
			<p>In addition to scripts that <a href="scripts.html">scripts that run during the actual installation</a>, you can also add scripts that check the user's machine to validate that an install can occur. The <code>InstallationCheck</code> script validates that the install can be done on the user's machine while the <code>VolumeCheck</code> validates that the install can be done on a specific volume. After 10.3, Installer.app asks the user before running these scripts.</p>

			<p>For details on writing these scripts by hand, see the following pages in the Software Distribution documentation:</p>

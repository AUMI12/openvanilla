OpenVanilla 0.7.2: Framework, Loaders and Modules 
Copyright (c) 2004-2006 The OpenVanilla Project

Last updated: 2006-01-16

== To Build OpenVanilla 0.7.2 for OS X ==

From version 0.7.2 on, the build system is simplified. Although you can
"sudo make install" to build install everything, this is discouraged
following the xcodebuild's convention. Instead, try to build and install
everything with the following commands:

* make DSTROOT=/tmp/foobar install
* sudo cp -r /tmp/foobar/* /

This extra step allows you to examine the built files or even set
appropriate ownership before you "sudo cp" and overwrite everything.

== Note for OS X Users ==

Although the Loader 0.7.2 uses a different bundle name and a different
bundle identifier, OS X does not allow 0.7.2 to co-work with 0.7.1--
although they can show up together in the "input menu," you won't be
able to choose either of them until you uncheck one of them in the
input menu.

== Note for Linux/FreeBSD/Windows Users -- IMPORTANT!! ==

Currently we're working on the release of the OS X version of 0.7.2;
as of 16 January 2006, EVERY DIRECTORY YOU HAVE SEEN HERE HAVE UNDERGONE
TREMENDOUS RELOCATION OR SIMPLY REMOVAL. At the present time only
the OS X version will build. Neither a build for Linux/FreeBSD (OV-SCIM)
or one for Windows (OVIME) is scheduled due to our limited resource. If
you would like to build from source code, please DO NOT USE THE CODE IN
THE trunk/ , please checkout instead from the branches/0.7.1 as in :

    http://svn.openfoundry.org/openvanilla/branches/0.7.1

Or, if you would like to checkout from the trunk, please use the version
PRIOR to r1588 (from the point of which on the work of 0.7.2 began).
